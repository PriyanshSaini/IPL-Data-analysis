# IPL-Data-analysis

### **Project Description: IPL Data Analysis**

This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and deliveries. The goal is to derive meaningful insights, player statistics, team performances, and match outcomes using structured SQL queries. By leveraging this data, we aim to uncover trends and patterns that can be used to understand the dynamics of IPL cricket.

### **Objective**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on IPL match and delivery datasets.
2. Answer critical questions about players, teams, and matches through SQL queries.
3. Generate actionable insights for teams, players, and cricket enthusiasts.
4. Demonstrate proficiency in SQL for querying, aggregating, and analyzing data.

### **Tasks Completed**

#### **1. Database Design**
- Created two tables: `deliveries` and `matches` to store IPL match and ball-by-ball delivery data.

#### **2. Data Exploration and Querying**
- **Top 5 Players with the Most "Player of the Match" Awards:** Identified players who consistently performed well and received the most awards.
- **Matches Won by Each Team in Each Season:** Determined the number of matches won by each team in different seasons.
- **Batsmenâ€™s Average Strike Rate:** Calculated the strike rate for all batsmen to evaluate their performance.
- **Matches Won by Teams Batting First vs. Batting Second:** Compared the success rate of teams batting first versus chasing.

#### **3. Player and Team Analysis**
- **Highest Strike Rate (Minimum 200 Runs):** Found the batsman with the highest strike rate among those who scored at least 200 runs.
- **Dismissals by Specific Bowlers:** Identified how many times batsmen were dismissed by a specific bowler (e.g., SL Malinga).
- **Boundary Statistics:** Analyzed the average percentage of boundaries (fours and sixes) hit by batsmen and teams.
- **Highest Partnership:** Determined the highest partnership in terms of runs for each team in each season.

#### **4. Match Insights**
- **Extras Bowled by Teams:** Analyzed extras like wides and no-balls conceded by teams.
- **Best Bowling Figures in a Match:** Identified bowlers with the most wickets taken in a single match.
- **Matches Won by Teams in Each City:** Determined team performances based on the city where the match was played.

#### **5. Season Trends**
- **Toss Wins per Team per Season:** Analyzed how often teams won the toss during each IPL season.
- **Runs Scored Per Over:** Calculated the average number of runs scored in each over of every match.

#### **6. Performance Records**
- **Highest Team Total:** Found which team scored the highest runs in a single match.
- **Highest Individual Score:** Identified batsmen with the highest individual scores in a match.

### **Outcomes**
1. Discovered key insights about player performance and team strategies.
2. Identified trends such as which teams perform better in different scenarios (batting first vs. second).
3. Recognized star players and game-changers based on metrics like strike rate, dismissals, and awards.
4. Highlighted areas of improvement for teams, such as reducing extras and better bowling strategies.

### **Skills Demonstrated**
1. Advanced SQL querying techniques (e.g., `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries).
2. Analytical thinking to answer complex questions.
3. Aggregation and statistical analysis of cricket data.
4. Database management and schema design for relational databases.
